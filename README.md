## Demo of FileMaker custom-apps
Here are collected various test projects or demo FileMaker databases. The files were created as a sample (for example, prototype) a workable (maybe) design. Every file is absolutely working, it can be downloaded and used. But since this is a demo file, it has no access as administrator. To work with this files, use the username "Tester". The password is not needed.

Keep in mind, FileMaker files are (a) binary and (b) large.

You can always write comments and suggestions in the comments.
