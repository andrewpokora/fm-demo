# PrintShop Job Tickets

## About
This is a simple example of solution for printshop. I made this just for fun, when I saw the open challenge on Upworks. This task was accompanied by a description and a screenshot -- see it in OriginalScreen.png

I think it's better to store data about tickets and customers in different tables and work with them in different tables. In addition, in the future it will allow track information about the contact persons in the companies-customers or companies-partners.

## Ideas
1. Automatic price calculation of job complexity (e.g. printing+diecutting+lamination)
2. Tracking materials on Warehouse
3. Notification of low inventory via email or SMS
4. Notifications to customers about jobs status via email or SMS
5. Invoices and payment control
6. Export payment data for the accountant

## Limitations
The file runs in the 14th and 15th version. In order to work with the file, use the username Tester. The password is not needed.

You can't edit the layers, variables, or anything else. You can add the data — but once the number of entries exceeds 25, the all data will be cleared. Please keep this in mind. This file is not intended for real work — it's just a concept that could be done for the customer, but remained at the level of ideas.
