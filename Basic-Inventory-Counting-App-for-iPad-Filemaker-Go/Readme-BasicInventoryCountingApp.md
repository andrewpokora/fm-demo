# Basic Inventory Counting App for iPad Filemaker Go

## About

This solution is offered as minimum viable product (MVP), as a database with just enough features to gather validated learning about the final product and its continued development. I made this just for fun, when I saw the open challenge on Upworks. This file is not intended for real work — it's just a concept.

Subject to the foregoing:
- not all functions that need to be in the final solution implemented in full. For example, reports and graphs can be implemented in future versions;
- design provides data entry and display them, but no more;
- testing on different devices was conducted.

To work with the file, use the username "Tester". The password is not needed.

In addition, the file contains a limit on the number of entries you can make - "Threshold limit". After the limit is exceeded, data about items or orders will be lost. Be careful. Do not use this file for real work.

If you are interested - just email me your questions and suggestions and we will discuss further work.

## Current Status
In Progress

## Limitations
1. The file runs in FileMaker Pro, FileMaker Pro Advanced and File Maker Go the 14th and 15th version.
2. You can't edit the layers, variables, or anything else.
3. You can add the any data — but once the number of entries exceeds 25, the all data will be cleared. Please keep this in mind.
