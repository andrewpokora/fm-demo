# TimeTracker

## About
It's just a prototype for a demonstration of the concept. Not recommended for real work.

## Files
- TimeTracker.fmp12 - sample of database
- schema.png - schema of work
- 01-dashboard.png - dashboard (desktop)
- 02-employee - employee list (desktop)
- 03-departments  - departments (desktop)
- 04-reports - reports screen (desktop)
- 05-iPad - entering PIN-code (iPad)

## User Access
For test access, in a file created few account:
Employee - without a password, to enter the pin code on the iPad
Manager - no password, to work with reports

## Work
It is recommended to place the database on the server. In this case, when accessing the iPad, the user "Employee" will see the layout for entering the password (or scanning the barcode). When a user opens database from the desktop, the user "Manager" will see layouts for work with employees, reports and the so on.

## Limitations
The file runs in the 14th and 15th version. 

You can't edit the layers, variables, or anything else. You can add the data — but once the number of entries exceeds 25, the all data will be cleared. Please keep this in mind. This file is not intended for real work — it's just a concept that could be done for the customer, but remained at the level of ideas.
