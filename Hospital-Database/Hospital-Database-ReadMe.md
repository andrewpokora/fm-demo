# Hospital Database

## About
This is a simple example of solution for rounds-list in hospital. I made this just for fun, when I saw the open challenge on Upworks. This task was accompanied by a description -- see it in Signout_Databases.pdf

I think it's better to store data about tickets and customers in different tables and work with them in different tables. In addition, in the future it will allow track information about the contact persons in the companies-customers or companies-partners.

## Current Status
In Progress

## Limitations
The file runs in the 14th and 15th version. In order to work with the file, use the username Tester. The password is not needed.

You can't edit the layers, variables, or anything else. You can add the data — but once the number of entries exceeds 25, the all data will be cleared. Please keep this in mind. This file is not intended for real work — it's just a concept that could be done for the customer, but remained at the level of ideas.
