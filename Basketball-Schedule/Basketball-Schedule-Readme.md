# Basketball-Schedule

## About
This a sample of FM-database to establish and control the schedule of employment of the basketball hall.

I made this just for fun, when I saw the open challenge on Upworks. This task was accompanied by a description and a screenshot -- see it in OriginalScreen.png

In this decision, I decided to do without navigation on the main screen with the buttons. There are several reasons:
- they take up much space;
- if a command is added or removed will have to redo the layout;
- in addition, on the main screen you should see the schedule. It's the schedule, right?..

Anyway, I made a sample timetable on the proposed description and in its sole discretion.

## Files
- Basketball-Schedule.fmp12	- sample of database
- OriginalScreen.png - screenshot from original task
- Srceens.zip - archive with screenshots of this database

## Ideas
I think a good idea to add the following features:
- the list of players in teams;
- the calculation of the path to the hall;
- notifications by SMS about the beginning of the training.

Sorting in portals works - just click on the column header with the data. It was possible to make a filter to search in the portal — but for such a sample it was a waste of time.

## Limitations
The file runs in the 14th and 15th version. In order to work with the file, use the username Tester. The password is not needed.

You can't edit the layers, variables, or anything else. You can add the data — but once the number of entries exceeds 25, the all data will be cleared. Please keep this in mind. This file is not intended for real work — it's just a concept that could be done for the customer, but remained at the level of ideas.
