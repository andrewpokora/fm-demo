# Basketball-Schedule
Sample of FM database.
Just for fun. Guest access open.
In this solution, I decided not to do the navigation from the main screen via buttons. They take up a lot of space; if a team is added or removed, you need to redo the layout; and besides -- on the main screen you need to see the schedule. It's the schedule, right?.. 

Sorting in portals work -- just click on the column heading with the data. New data cannot be added. Actually, you can ;-) but you need to have access rights. I can add a filter (search) for user data in the portal. I would have added more information about the teams and players -- in this version looks too... Austere.

Works fine in FileMaker 14. Of course, in 15 too. But at 13 I would not advise to open the file -- the buttons are ugly :(

In the end -- don't shoot the pianist. I did a couple of hours as is considered proper. Correct me if I'm wrong :)
