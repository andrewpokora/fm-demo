# Basic Inventory Counting App for iPad Filemaker Go

## About
This is a simple example of solution. I made this just for fun, when I saw the open challenge on Upworks. This file is not intended for real work — it's just a concept.

In order to work with the file, use the username Tester. The password is not needed.

## Current Status
In Progress

##Last Updates
See commit history.

## Limitations
1. The file runs in FileMaker Pro, FileMaker Pro Advanced and File Maker Go the 14th and 15th version.
2. You can't edit the layers, variables, or anything else. You can add the data — but once the number of entries exceeds 25, the all data will be cleared. Please keep this in mind.
