# Donor Management

## About
This is a simple example of solution for donor management. I made this just as prototype for real customer. I did it as part of a real project. This project was abandoned and not brought to completion. However, it is quite a working solution.

## Files
- DonorManagement.fmp12	- file of database

## User Access
File started with user User without password. User have [Data Entry Only] access level

## Limitations
You can't edit the layers, variables, or anything else. You can only add the data. Please keep this in mind. This file is not intended for real work â€” it's just a concept that could be done for the customer, but remained at the level of ideas.
