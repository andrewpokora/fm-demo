# Hospital Database

## About
This is a simple example of solution for rounds-list in hospital. I made this just for fun, when I saw the open challenge on Upworks. This file is not intended for real work — it's just a concept that could be done for the customer, but remained at the level of ideas.

In order to work with the file, use the username Tester. The password is not needed.

## Limitations
1. The file runs in the 14th and 15th version.
2. You can't edit the layers, variables, or anything else. You can add the data — but once the number of entries exceeds 25, the all data will be cleared. Please keep this in mind.
